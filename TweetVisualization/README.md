# Tweet Visualizations

This app includes a server that provides an api into the tweet data, and some examples of visualising the results.

## Running the Example

Open this folder in terminal and run the following commands:

* `npm install`
* `npm run build`
* `npm start`

Then visit https://localhost:3000 in your web browser!

To run the client with hot-reload:
* `npm start`
* `npm run dev`

Then visit https://localhost:8080.  Api calls will be proxied to the server on 3000.
